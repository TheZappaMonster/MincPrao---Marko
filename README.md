##**First day!**

I came in, sat down on the bench, i saw Joel stepping in, then Marcel came in. We said hello shook hands and i met Chris. 

Joel showed us around a bit, we sat down at the local *"sitting"* area.

We spoke a bit about the plan, times to show up and events. We met some new people that showed us some new stuff we have never seen before. They usually start some small companies and wants to get big, like for example facebook.

You actually don't have to be in time, it's mostly free. The "goal" is to work from 09:00-16:00 but if you come like, 09:30 you could stay to like 16:30. It's pretty cool here, i like it. 

Joel then told us to create a github account. Github is like a facebook, but for programmers. We made one and started writing some simple programming.

We worked like 2h on github until it was lunch. We ate, played some ping-pong and started working again.

##**Second day!**

Me and Marcel watched a presentation from an american about how to perfect your [**pitch**] (http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch). Then we worked with a presentation and a *"manuscript"*. I wrote on the whiteboard and i presented my idea for Marcel.
